# Power-BI-Project

### Bank Loan performance Analysis Using Power BI 
This project seeks to delve deep into a lending loan dataset to uncover the relationship between borrower behavior (such as employment length, income, and debt-to-income ratio) and loan characteristics (including amount, term, and interest rate) to unearth critical insights into loan performance metrics. By examining patterns in loan statuses such as fully paid, charged off, or late payments, this analysis aims to empower banking institutions with actionable insights to optimize loan lending strategies, mitigate credit risk, and enhance performance.[Bank Loan performance Analysis](https://github.com/arunprasath23072002/Power-BI-Project/blob/main/Power%20BI%20Capstone%20Project_%20Bank%20Loan%20Performance%20Analysis.pdf)
